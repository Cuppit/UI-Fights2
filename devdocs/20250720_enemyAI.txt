So the basic battle loop needs to be established.  Let's do that here:
	-Main Game UI tracks which character's turn it is
	
	-Character executes an action
		-attack
		-defend
		-use a special ability
		-use item (not yet implemented)
		
		 Needs to be implemented in such a way that, no matter what the player chooses,
		always (under normal circumstances) passes turn to the opponent.  That is, coded
		in such a way that "pass turn" doesn't have to be explicitly programmed into every
		single possible action.  How to do so?  Wrap all actions into a main "act" function
		which has "pass turn" as it's final action.  So...taking a break--

NPC AI IMPLEMENTATION

	-percent chance associated with each possible action (based on current attitude)
	-action chosen randomly
		-If attitude is associated with a specific action, attitude is adjusted appropriately
		-action executes
	-post-action attitude is selected based on some kind of criteria
	
	QUESTION: does a character process it's own turn?  or does the main game UI process the turn?
	ANSWER: the character processes it's own turn
		-IF "process turn" is called without specifying an action or target, then the proces turn
		method itself chooses what action the character takes based on the criteria discussed
		above.
		
		IMPLEMENTATION DECISION: if Character.process_turn(abi="", tgt=target) is called with no ability
		specified (e.g. the empty string, ""), that turn will be processed automatically as if by AI
		control.
	

1) implement passing turn from player to opponent (implemented?)

ALSO: need to implement "guard" ability for the sake of having options aside from attack to choose from

GUARDING IMPLEMENTATION
	-A flag in GameCharacter indicates whether a character is currently guarding
	-if YES, net defense/evasion is boosted by 1/3 (33%)
		(NOTE: From a gameplay perspective, this is almost useless.  Damage needs to be reduced to 
		 a degree that it would actually be a worthwhile choice.  Hence, something significant,
		 such as reducing damage by half, would be good.)

SO: implement passing turn to opponent now.
IMPLEMENTATION
	-The "pass_turn()" function, if called during the player's turn:
		-flips the flag to "it's currently the opponent's turn"
		-calls the "process turn" function with no ability, and opponent as the
		 target
		-finishes resolving whatever ability it chooses based on the criteria
		 that will be designed and implemented
		-calls "pass_turn()" again, which sees that it's the opponents turn, and
		 thus flips the current turn to being the player's turn
	
So that is currently implemented.  now we implement enemy AI.
HOW DOES IT WORK?


Each character has a dictionary of "action preferences":
	Key : Attitude
	Value: another dictionary:
		Key: action name (string)
		Value: action weight (int)
		
WHAT HAPPENS WITH THESE ATTITUDES?
	-Action is chosen based on current attitude
	-action executes
	-attitude is adjusted like so:
		-If special conditions are met, change to appropriate personality
		-else if HP is below fainting threshold, change to "fainting" personality
		-else, randomly select attitude based on character's personality

AGAINST ALL ODDS, IT WORKS.  A RUDIMENTARY AI WORKS.  I'm pretty excited about
this, it's the first time I've managed to pull off a decision-making
system with any kind of substance to it.

Back at it; so now conditions for the battle actually ending need to be implemented.
END BATTLE CONDITION:
	One or both characters have HP of 0 at the end of a turn
	
WHERE DOES THE CHECK_FOR_END_OF_BATTLE FUNCTION HAPPEN?
	-MainGameUI
		-
		...

was distracted, but spent last 5 minutes doing an easy fix in the "pass_turn()" function
for the main game UI, now the game just kind of ends once one opponent is dead.

WHERE TO GO FROM HERE?
	Couple options:
		-Design progression loop
		-Design Stats screen
		-Design starting method
		-Decouple classes into globally defined concepts so they aren't taking up room
		 in the MainGameUI
		-refactor code into a bigger projects

Well this has been fun but it's time to call it a night.  Last things done:
	-Stitched Godot-game-template fragments into the project to try and expand
	 it out a little more
	
	-threw in a couple music players into the nodes:
		-Heros' Prayer Land Theme Loop by pyroguy-37:
			https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/59993
		
		-Some other track I threw together using LMMS and the Fatboy soundfont
		 (I call it 'buildup'):
