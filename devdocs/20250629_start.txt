OBJECTIVE: make a simple UI turn-based 1v1 battler, similar to 
Sinjid.

PRESENTATION:
	-UI with two main components:
		-Player stats + controls/options
		-enemy stats + misc details
	
	
GAME LOOP:
	-Player makes character creation choices
	-Player enters first battle
		-player chooses an option in battle
		-turn passes to enemy
		-enemy performs an action
		-turn passes to player
		-loop repeats until one or both sides HP is zero
	-after first battle, player is taken to management UI 
	-after completing any changes, player is brought to next battle
	-game cycle continues until there are no more battles and the player 
	has won, or the player's HP reaches 0 at which point the game ends

GAME MECHANICS

basic principles
	-On average, a level 1 player character should be defeatable after sustaining 3 enemy hits
	-A level 1 player should level up after two successful battles 
	-a suitable challenge for a level 1 player should be an enemy that is able to get at least one 
	 hit in on the player before being defeated (e.g. can sustain 2 basic attacks from the player
	if they go first, and 1 basic attack from the player if they go second)
	
Whatever stats are built should revolve around these level design rules

MAKING THE RULES

It's a hard ask to make decisions

22:44
So an almost breakthrough happened, until the realization that a game hasn't 
actually been designed.  How do gameplay mechanics work, exactly?  When
a character attacks, what actually happens?  Is there a chance that 
attacks miss?  How is that determined?  Is it the D20 system with AC? 
Or is damage reduced by wearing armor?  What's the rules?



22:57
--TODO FOR NEXT TIME--
	-actually hash out a combat system to implement
	-program the resulting system designed
	-make UI mock-up
