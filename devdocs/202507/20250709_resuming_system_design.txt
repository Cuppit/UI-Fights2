DETERMINING CHANCES OF HITTING OPPONENT

Chance to land hit: function of each opponents dex + str (for now)

just experimenting, don't need comprehensive ruleset.   Just need something
to test actual programming mechanics, can use to test game balance later

Damage: weapon damage + str + dex (stat damage scaling function/coefficient?)

---PROGRAMMING TAKING ACTIONS---

Flow is as follows:
	-Character calls "execute ability", which passes the ability selection and target
	 the abilities script
	
	-abilities script executes code for the result of the ability based on the characteristics
	 of the characters involved
	
	IMPLEMENTATION: a global script, "abilities.gd", which has the function that processes all
	abilities.

--- BASIC SCRIPT STRUCTURE IMPLEMENTED ---

NEXT STEP: Make basic UI mockup
