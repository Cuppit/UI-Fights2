Copy-paste a dream/todo list from last time's notes:

-post-battle rewards to player on victory (gold, xp, items, etc.)
-associate specific character portraits with specific characters
-finish "in-between-fights" UI design
-determine how items/inventory are managed/interact with UIs
	-Can other items be used in battle?  Do they simply equip them?
	-Is that a "bonus" action?
