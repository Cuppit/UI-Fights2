Today just going to focus on character management ui
until all the controls work

MANAGING EQUIPMENT
	-CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION
		-Menu button for each piece of equipment
	-WHAT DOES CLICKING ON THE MENU BUTTON DO?
		-For now?:
			-Gather list of weapons/armor/accessories currently in inventory
			-offers popupmenu options for each of them (including "unequip")
			-clicking on the associated one changes equipment with that item
	
	INVENTORY IS JUST A DICTIONARY OF STRING NAMES, HOW TO GET LIST OF 
	WEAPONS?
	
	ANSWER: redefine how inventory works
		-not just a flat dictionary, but a dictionary of dictionaries
			-each dictionary refers to a category of item: weapon, armor, acc, item, etc.
			
	BIG PROBLEM: Because held weapons, armor, etc. are only identified by their string name,
	it's difficult to know just from a string whether a name refers to an item, weapon,
	armor, or accessory.  So, any attempt to add something to the game involves 
	building a system to identify what type of item is, since the thing itself doesn't know
	anything else about itself.  
	
	PROPOSED SOLUTION: make a global function, "get-item-type", whose sole purpose is to search
	through every database until it finds a match for the type of the item.
	
	...
	
	MANUAL MANAGEMENT METHOD:
		-Current "GameCharacter.gain_item()" function will also require to specify the type of item.
		 This will put the string name in the appropriate part of inventory (weapons, item, etc.)

Too much time was spent messing with the character management UI and kludging solutions to inventory
buttons working in a specific way.  

TODO NEXT TIME:
	-Populate items in item belt in character management UI (including empty slots)
	-implement functionality: clicking on item in item belt lists all possible items 
	 that could fill that slot
