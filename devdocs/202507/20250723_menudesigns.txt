Character select screen is in development, after that will consider stats
menu, then figure out how much farther to take this project before wrapping it 
up, getting lessons learned, etc.

...

-- 20:15 CDT --
modulate properties of character portrait buttons: (1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 0.40)

...

Still need to figure out what content to put the character select.  Needs to be
a general description, a more specific description of pros and cons, and
explanation of their unique abilities/features

In the mean time, tweaked GameCharacter to include an "int" (intelligence) stat
to accommodate sage archetype whose abilities will rely more on int than 
other things.  What that will mean, I still need to design/determine.

Will wrap up for now, TODO for next time:
	-design/implement new abilities 
	-implement new characters in the database
	-implement character inventory and item-belts
	-incorporate intelligence as a character stat into the game
	-set up game menu to allow the player to choose a starting character
	-consider game-loop design considerations:
		-character progression (new equipment/better stats?)
		-in-between fights character management UI
