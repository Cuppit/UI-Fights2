Some more UI development overall accomplished today, still need to finish:
	-post-battle rewards to player on victory (gold, xp, items, etc.)
	-associate specific character portraits with specific characters
	-finish "in-between-fights" UI design
	-determine how items/inventory are managed/interact with UIs
		-Can other items be used in battle?  Do they simply equip them?
		-Is that a "bonus" action?
