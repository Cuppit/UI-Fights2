Basic mechanics/flow of function established, now curious about how to
implement factoring everything that could possibly affect the outcome 
(e.g. equipment, status effects).

To accomplish:
	-Finish implementing how outcomes are calculated
		-(e.g. which script is responsible for what calculations, GameCharacter or
		  Abilities?  How are the Weapon/Armor databases accessed?  How is 
		  inventory implemented/managed among characters?)

Also: still need to implement:
	-enemy AI
	-Action Outcome messaging
	-UI design (what info about enemy does player have, how to describe
	action outcomes, visual effects?  Sound effects?)
	-Writing?  Character design (e.g. how to hook in the player on an
	emotional level, not just the raw "this is just some arena battler")

CONUNDRUM: The armor has been designed/programmed to ONLY be able
to provide armor bonuses.  Is that good from a design perspective?  Likewise
weapons were programmed to ONLY be able to provide weapon bonuses.  What if 
someone wants to design a weapon that also provides an armor bonus?  Or
vice versa?

But that's small compared to other problems.  I need to be able to log
messages

A rich text label will suffice for game messages
for now

PROBLEM: HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE BATTLE LOG?
	-What needs access to the battle log?
		-MainGameUI: Update the UI control that displays messages
		-Ability script: log event details as an ability resolves
		
TODO: figure out where the battle log lives so it can be accessed
appropriately by the other pieces of the game
